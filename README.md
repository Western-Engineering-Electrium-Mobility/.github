# Western Engineering Electrium Mobility (WEEM)

Western Engineering Electrium Mobility (WEEM) is an undergraduate student design team based at the University of Western Ontario. Our objective is to develop Personal Electric Vehicles that are both economical and environmentally friendly.
While other engineering teams revolve around one major build, Western Engineering Electrium Mobility intends to have multiple smaller projects running simultaneously, whilst providing a learning environment.
